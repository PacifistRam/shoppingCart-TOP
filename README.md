# Shopping Cart Project

This project was completed as part of The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum, focusing on implementing a shopping cart application using React. The main objectives included creating two main pages: one for displaying products fetched from a dummy API endpoint and another for managing the shopping cart.

### Technologies Used:
- React
- React Router library
- FakeShop API

### Implemented Features:
- Developed a custom hook to handle API fetch requests using `useRef` for fetching data as well as managing state related to loading and errors.
- Utilized `createBrowserRoutes` method to set up navigation routes.
- Leveraged React Router's context API for state management across different components.

### Challenges Faced:
- Initially struggled with passing props between multiple pages, as the traditional method didn't work well with React Router's outlet structure. Opted for using React Router's custom context API instead.
- CSS styling posed challenges due to numerous available options. Ultimately, opted for plain CSS, prioritizing functionality over extensive styling.

### Areas for Improvement:
- Enhance visual appeal with improved CSS styling to make the application more visually appealing.
- Implement refined user feedback mechanisms, such as pop-ups or notifications, to provide better visual feedback after adding items to the cart.

This project aims to provide a functional shopping cart experience while focusing on React development fundamentals. Future improvements will focus on enhancing usability and aesthetics to create a more polished user interface.
